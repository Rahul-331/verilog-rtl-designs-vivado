# Verilog RTL Designs (Vivado)

This repository contains some of the basic RTL designs that I implemented using Verilog HDL and verified in Xilinx Vivado.

I created this project to strengthen my understanding of digital design fundamentals including combinational logic, sequential logic, and FSM design.

---

## Implemented Designs

### Combinational Circuits
- Half Adder
- Full Adder
- 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder

### Sequential Circuits
- D Flip-Flop (Asynchronous Reset)
- 4-bit Up-Down Counter
- Traffic Light Controller (Moore FSM)

Each design includes:
- Verilog RTL code
- Testbench
- Simulation verification in Vivado

---

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado
- Git & GitHub

---

## Why I Built This
The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in RTL design and understand how digital circuits behave at the hardware level.

More designs will be added as I continue learning.
